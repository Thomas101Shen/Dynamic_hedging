# Dyanmic Hedging

TBD

Runs on Python3.10.16
`python --version` (should output 3.10.16)
It might work with other versions (no guarantee so far)
Definitely won't work with anything later than 3.10.16 (because of pytorch)

On mac you can install it with the following command (if brew is installed)
`brew install python@3.10`


install dependenceis by running the following: `pip install requirements.txt`
